# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle. It can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data). The dataset contains a large number of anonymized credit card transactions, including both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Each transaction is described by a set of features, such as time, amount, and various transformed values (V1, V2, ..., V28) obtained through a PCA transformation due to privacy concerns.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.10.12)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure

- `credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the credit card fraud detection project.
- `creditcard.csv`: The dataset file containing the credit card transaction data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
3. Open the `credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results

The project aims to build a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. The final model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are reported.

## Conclusion

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both consumers and financial institutions. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the provided dataset and implementing appropriate preprocessing and modeling techniques, it is possible to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Please note that this project serves as a starting point and can be further enhanced by incorporating additional features, exploring different algorithms, and employing advanced techniques for anomaly detection and fraud prevention.
